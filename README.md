# Top 250 Indian Movies (IMDb)

## What is the report about?
I have created an interactive dashboard that shows the details of the top 250 Indian movies of all time.

## Steps 

-Extracted the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmars1010/imdb-top250-india and transformed it using Power Query in Power BI.

-Created a 2-page interactive dashboard which shows the details of the movie and summary statistics on the second page.

-The first page shows the details of the movie such as genre, language, awards and nominations, industry, directors, box office collection, user reviews, watch hours and descriptions.

-The second page shows the number of movies with details of the industry which are streamed on online platforms in a ribbon chart and another chart shows the details of the box collection of the different film industries.
