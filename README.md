I have created an interactive dashboard which shows the details of the top 250 Indian Movies of all time. The content of the dashboard are as follows;
o	Extracted the data and transformed the data using Power Query
o	Created 2 paged interactive dashboard which shows the details of the movie and summary statistics in the second pages
o	The first page shows the details of the movie such as genre, language, awards and nominations, industry, directors, box office collection, user reviews, watch hour and descriptions
o	The second page shows the number of movies with details of the industry which are streamed on online platforms in ribbon chart and another chart which shows the details of the box collection of the different film industry,
